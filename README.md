Description: Function to reverse the digits of an integer.

Python Features: String manipulation, conditionals (if, elif, else).

2.Recursive_Factorial02.py

Description: Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

Python Features: Recursion, base case handling.

3.Most_Common03.py

Description: Function to find the most frequently occurring character in a string.

Python Features: Counter, string manipulation.

4.Identify_Pangram04.py

Description: Function to determine if a string is a pangram.

Python Features: Sets, string.ascii_lowercase.

5.Consecutive_Threes05.py

Description: Function to check if a list of integers contains two consecutive threes.

Python Features: Iteration (for loop), conditional statements (if).

6.Reversed_Words06.py

Description: Function to reverse the order of words in a sentence.

Python Features: String splitting and joining, list manipulation.

Test cases at the end of each script ensure correctness and functionality.
